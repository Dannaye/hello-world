# hello-world
Don't really know what I'm doing just following directions. I am taking part in a competition known as a 'datathon' and was instruced to creat a github account as well as downlaod Anaconda and install github client. My name is Danny Samaniego I am a senior student-athlete at Kearny Science, Connections, and Technology. Due to a series of unfortunate events I am currently unable to play or practice any of the three sports I play (Football, Wrestling, and Volleyball) and have an inmense amount of free time on my hands, thus I have decided to further my coding skills.
